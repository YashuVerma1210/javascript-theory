// default behaviour
// javascript is synchronous
// js is single threaded

// javascript engine is never used alone, always in runtime env


// global execution context
// lines are executed one by one
// each operation waits for prev operation to complete

// file read process
// program can't read file
// execution is transferred to kernel
// kernel reads the file
// excecution gets back to program
// file read done

// blocking code (sync code)
// Ex - read file sync

// non blocking code (async code)
// Ex - read file async

// JS Engine                      Web API/node - DOM API, Set Interval, SetTimeout, fetch
//                                   Register Callback

// JS Engine - Memory Heap and Call Stack

// Task Queue
// Promise task queue - priority queue

// Event loop
